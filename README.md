# JavaScript on Rust

`rjs` is a native JavaScript implementation in Rust.

## The project

The goal of `rjs` is to provide a fast, native JavaScript implementation in Rust.
Currently `rjs` is in alpha which means that the performance and stability is
not representative of where we want to end up, and that the public API may still
change. See the [roadmap](https://github.com/rust-js/rjs/wiki/Roadmap) for a detailed
description of the current state of the project and the end goals.
